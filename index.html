            <strong><h2>About Me</h2></strong>
                 <p>Hello world! My name is Albert Kim and I love my cat, Charlie! You can see a picture of him to the left. He may not be the cutest, but he is the most lovable, but enough of my cat. This site is all about me. I am 25 years old and I am currently enrolled in the UNEX coding boot camp program. Before this, I was a property manager at a commercial building. I was in charge of twin buildings in the heart of Koreatown. I realized after 2.5 years that this was not my passion. I dabbled in the some free resources available online. This helped me realize that I enjoyed learning and writing code. This realization helped me move to pursue my dream to become a web developer.</p>
