                 <p class = 'bio'>Hello world! My name is Albert Kim and I love my cat, Charlie! You can see a picture of him to the left. He may not be the cutest, but he is the most lovable; but enough of my cat, this site is all about me! </p>
<br/>
                 <p class = 'bio'>I am 25 years old and I am currently enrolled in the UNEX coding boot camp program. Before this, I was a property manager at a commercial building. I was in charge of twin buildings in the heart of Koreatown. I realized after 2.5 years that this was not my passion. I searched online what a suitable career change could be, dabbled in  some free resources available online and realized that this was waht I wanted to do. This realization helped me to pursue my dream to become a web developer.</p>
